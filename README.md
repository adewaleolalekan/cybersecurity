# Cybersecurity Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and case studies designed to practice and showcase skills in cybersecurity. Each project covers key concepts, from breach analysis to hands-on secure network simulation.

---

## Project 1: Incident Report: Malware Traffic Analysis
A capstone project involving the forensic analysis of a network packet capture (pcap) to investigate a malware infection. This report details the full incident lifecycle from initial infection to C2 communication.

### Key Activities:
- Analyzed DNS and HTTP traffic in Wireshark to reconstruct the attack timeline.
- Identified malicious file downloads, PowerShell payloads, and persistence mechanisms.
- Uncovered primary and secondary Command & Control (C2) channels, including a RAT.
- Compiled a detailed list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and provided a three-tiered mitigation plan.

## Project 2: Lab - Simple LAN with Cisco Packet Tracer
A hands-on lab demonstrating the creation and testing of a basic Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer on a Linux system.

### Lab Features:
- Built a star topology with two PCs and a central switch.
- Configured static IP addresses and subnet masks on end devices.
- Verified end-to-end connectivity using the ping command.
- Demonstrates foundational skills in networking, simulation, and troubleshooting.

## Project 3: Lab - VLAN Configuration & Inter-VLAN Routing
A hands-on lab focused on network segmentation using Virtual LANs (VLANs) and enabling communication between them with a Layer 3 switch.

### Lab Features:
- Created and named two distinct VLANs (Admin & Guest).
- Configured Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) to act as default gateways.
- Enabled IP routing on a Layer 3 switch to allow for inter-VLAN communication.
- Verified connectivity between VLANs using ping.

## Project 4: Lab - Wireshark Traffic Capture & Analysis
A practical lab involving the capture and analysis of live network traffic using Wireshark to identify protocols, detect anomalies, and assess security posture.

### Lab Highlights:
- Captured live network traffic during a typical user session..
- Analyzed protocol distribution (QUIC, TCP, UDP) and encryption levels.
- Identified potential security threats, including UDP port scanning and DNS tunneling characteristics.

## Project 5: Case Study - Risk Assessment for a Fintech Company
A comprehensive risk assessment for a fictional fintech company, "NextGen Solutions." This project involves identifying critical assets, analyzing threats, and developing a prioritized risk register and mitigation plan.

### Key Activities:
- Defined the scope of the assessment, including key assets and security domains.
- Created a risk register identifying threats like phishing, insider misuse, and API exploits.
- Developed a risk matrix to prioritize vulnerabilities based on impact and likelihood.
- Proposed detailed mitigation strategies for top-priority risks.

## Project 6: Report - GDPR Compliance Checklist for a Fintech Company
An external compliance officer's report for a fictional fintech company, "NextGen Solutions." This project applies GDPR principles to a specific business context, providing actionable recommendations.

### Key Features:
- Outlines key GDPR requirements, from lawful basis for processing to data subject rights.
- Provides a detailed, actionable checklist for tracking compliance status across an organization.

## Project 7: Lab - Implementing RBAC in Linux
A hands-on lab demonstrating the configuration of Role-Based Access Control on a Linux file system using standard permissions and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

### Key Activities:
- Defined roles (Admin, Staff, Guest) with specific, multi-layered permissions.
- Used chmod, chown, and setfacl to implement the access control policy.
- Tested permissions for each role to verify the configuration and enforce least privilege.
- Documented the importance of ACLs for providing granular access beyond standard Unix permissions.

## Project 8: Lab - Secure Network Topology Design
A lab focused on designing and implementing a secure network for a small office using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates a defense-in-depth strategy.

### Key Features:
- Designed a segmented network with distinct Office, Guest, and DMZ zones using VLANs.
- Configured a Cisco ASA firewall with security levels and explicit access control rules.
- Isolated the public-facing web server in a DMZ to protect the internal network.
- Tested firewall rules to verify that traffic between zones was correctly blocked or permitted.

## Project 9: Lab - Web Application Vulnerability Scan
A vulnerability assessment of the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) using OWASP ZAP and manual testing techniques.

### Key Activities:
- Performed passive and active scans to identify common web application vulnerabilities.
- Manually tested and validated high-severity findings like SQL Injection, XSS, and Command Injection.
- Provided proof-of-concept payloads and observed results for each validated vulnerability.
- Developed a clear remediation plan for each identified issue.

## Project 10: Case Study - The Equifax Data Breach
A research report analyzing the 2017 Equifax data breach. This case study breaks down the attack timeline, root causes, and impact, drawing critical lessons for organizational security.

### Key Analysis Points:
- Detailed timeline of the breach events from vulnerability disclosure to public announcement.
- Analysis of the primary attack vector (Apache Struts vulnerability) and compounding failures.
- Examination of the financial, reputational, and operational impacts.
- Actionable recommendations for preventing similar incidents in any organization.
