## Project 3: Lab - VLAN Configuration & Inter-VLAN Routing
A hands-on lab focused on network segmentation using Virtual LANs (VLANs) and enabling communication between them with a Layer 3 switch.

### Lab Features:
- Created and named two distinct VLANs (Admin & Guest).
- Configured Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) to act as default gateways.
- Enabled IP routing on a Layer 3 switch to allow for inter-VLAN communication.
- Verified connectivity between VLANs using ping.
